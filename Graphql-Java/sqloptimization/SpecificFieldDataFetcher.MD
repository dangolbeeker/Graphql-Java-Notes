By only selecting the requested columns in the SQL query, we can ensure that only the necessary data is retrieved from the database, 
resulting in improved performance and reduced network traffic.


How to retrieve only the columns that have been requested in a GraphQL query when using a PostgreSQL database with the DataFetcher class in Java?
 One way to achieve this is to use a SQL query that only selects the requested columns. 

Here is an example of how to do this using the PreparedStatement class in Java:

import graphql.schema.DataFetcher;
import graphql.schema.DataFetchingEnvironment;

public class BookDataFetcher implements DataFetcher<Book> {

    private Connection connection;

    public BookDataFetcher(Connection connection) {
        this.connection = connection;
    }

    @Override
    public Book get(DataFetchingEnvironment environment) {
        // Get book id from query arguments
        String bookId = environment.getArgument("id");

        try {
            // Prepare SQL query to select only the requested columns
            String query = "SELECT title, author FROM books WHERE id = ?";
            PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(query);
            pstmt.setString(1, bookId);

            // Execute query and get result set
            ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
            rs.next(); // Move cursor to first row

            // Extract data from result set and create Book object
            String title = rs.getString("title");
            String author = rs.getString("author");
            Book book = new Book(bookId, title, author);

            // Close statement and result set
            pstmt.close();
            rs.close();

            return book;
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            // Handle exception
        }

        return null;
    }
}
